The purpose of this project was to explore manipulating a JSON file and turn it into a DataFrame. 

Steps taken in the project:
1. Create a JSON dataset.
2. Separate like keys and values into separate datasets via tuples
3. Combine them all together into one readable row with column headers
4. Create a DataFrame. 

Example JSON file created by me.
